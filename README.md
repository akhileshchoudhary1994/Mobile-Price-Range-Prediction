# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
To determine factors impacting our dependent variable mobile price range
Background Information
Personal cellphone has been around since the 1970's, however the first ever smartphone was invented in 1992 by IBM it call simon personal communicator.

Then come along the 3G network where it allow a smartphone to be connected to the internet.

This notebook, is an Exploratory data analysis on smartphone price range and how hardware inside of a smartphone will affect the price of a smartphone.

In this notebook we are going to predict on a smartphone price range based on the hardware feature using a machine learning classification method

Problem Statement

As the competition of smartphones get more and more competitive each day, finding the best pricing range for a smartphone would be a key strategy to have a profitable smartphone company.

However as there are more and more smartphone it's getting harder and harder for a company to justified a price range of a phone.

if a company set a smartphone that's too expensive with low computational power nobody is going to buy it, and if a company set a smartphone price range too low based on it's computational power the smartphone company is going to lose on potential profit.
