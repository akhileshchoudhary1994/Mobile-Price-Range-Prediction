# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

# INTRODUCTION

Personal cellphone has been around since the 1970's, however the first ever smartphone was invented in 1992 by IBM it call simon personal communicator.

Then come along the 3G network where it allow a smartphone to be connected to the internet.

After that in 2007 we have the first iphone where it almost revolutionize the smartphone idustry, as it was the sleekest designed phone and the first smart phone that offered a full unwatered down version of the internet

Fast forward to 2020, since the launch of iphone, major thing that happened to smart phone industry are The Launch of Android, the rise of application industry (and the monetazion of them), and more others.

As of today it's predicted that 2.5 billion people around the worlds own smartphone, with the growing numbers of smartphone ownership, the number of smartphone manufacturing is also growing. Smartphone companies launch a product that varies in computational power.

This notebook, is an Exploratory data analysis on smartphone price range and how hardware inside of a smartphone will affect the price of a smartphone.

In this notebook we are going to predict on a smartphone price range based on the hardware feature using a machine learning classification method

# Problem Statement

As the competition of smartphones get more and more competitive each day, finding the best pricing range for a smartphone would be a key strategy to have a profitable smartphone company.

However as there are more and more smartphone it's getting harder and harder for a company to justified a price range of a phone.

if a company set a smartphone that's too expensive with low computational power nobody is going to buy it, and if a company set a smartphone price range too low based on it's computational power the smartphone company is going to lose on potential profit.

# Machine Learning Goals

Predicting Phone Price Range Based on Their Specification

What Machine Learning classification models that has the best evaluation matrix to predict phone price based on their specification
This prediction could be useful for a mobile phone company to price their phone price range based a specification

# Conclusion

We can see that from all the evaluation matrix for this phone classfication, we see that, KNN after hyperparameter tuning without scalling has the best accuracy when it comes to predicting phone price range based on certain features.
